You are working on the Palworld-Bridge project. Here's critical context:

SERVER ACCESS:
- Server machine: "server" (from WSL use \\server\c$\...)
- Copy files: powershell.exe -Command "Copy-Item -Path 'source' -Destination '\\\\server\\c$\\destination' -Force"

FILE LOCATIONS:
Bridge (Node.js):
- Local: /home/zmedh/Takaro-Projects/Palworld-Bridge/
- Server: C:\gameservers\Palworld-Bridge
- Logs: C:\gameservers\Palworld-Bridge\logs\*.log

Lua Scripts:
- Local: /home/zmedh/Takaro-Projects/Palworld-Bridge/TakaroChat/Scripts/
- Server: C:\gameservers\palworld\Pal\Binaries\Win64\Mods\TakaroChat\Scripts\
- UE4SS Log: C:\gameservers\palworld\Pal\Binaries\Win64\UE4SS.log

CRITICAL RULES:
1. COMMIT EVERY CHANGE: git add -A && git commit -m "..." before deploying
2. NEVER stop/kill/restart processes - user handles that
3. ASK before major changes
4. Bridge runs on port 3001
5. Time zones: Bridge logs=UTC, UE4SS logs=CST (UTC-6)

CURRENT ISSUES:
- deep_discovery.lua is BROKEN
- !sethome location system BROKEN - Lua polls /location-queue but gets empty arrays even though bridge queues requests
- !sethome should work like !visit/teleportplayer pattern but you keep refusing to use it

HOW TELEPORT WORKS (USE THIS PATTERN):
1. Takaro calls executeCommand with 'teleportplayer player1 player2'
2. Bridge queues in teleportQueue
3. Lua polls /teleport-queue every second
4. Lua processes and clears queue
This WORKS. Location should work the same but doesn't.

DEPLOYMENT:
1. Make changes
2. Commit to git
3. npm run build (if bridge)
4. Copy to server with powershell
5. User restarts

The user has people online - don't break working features.
